# 💄 Chiffon Cosmetics - Sales Tools

## 🎯 Purpose & Business Value
Creates a simple, browser-based tool that requires **no installation** and leverages free-tier tools commonly available to small businesses. Calculates **net selling prices** by factoring in purchase price, distribution costs, marketing, salaries, taxes, commissions, and other expenses. Outputs feed directly into the Sales Sheet, which logs daily transactions and generates **reporting-ready CSVs** for Power BI dashboards.  

This project highlights **practical and simple problem-solving**, enabling small businesses to automate routine calculations and maintain accurate, consistent data **without investing in costly infrastructure** such as databases, instead leveraging freely available tools like Excel and Power BI.

## 🛠 Tools & Approach
This project demonstrates practical problem-solving and understanding of JavaScript, browser storage, and data handling. It leverages browser features and libraries (like **PapaParse** for CSV parsing) to manage data efficiently. While it uses JavaScript and DOM manipulation, the emphasis is on understanding workflow, data handling, and business logic, rather than claiming expert-level mastery of every underlying API.

**Key Tools & Technologies:**  
- **💻 JavaScript**: Handles dynamic calculations, input validation, and user interactions.  
- **🌐 HTML/CSS**: Provides a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.  
- **📂 PapaParse**: Efficiently parses and generates CSV files for import/export.  
- **💾 Browser LocalStorage**: Persists product pricing and sales data across sessions without requiring a backend database.  

> The project demonstrates practical application of JavaScript, browser storage, and data handling, leveraging libraries and browser features where appropriate, **without claiming expert-level mastery** of every underlying API.
